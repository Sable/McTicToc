Run:

python runner.py inside the directory to run the benchmark multiple times and produce the tables used in the report.

Alternatively, from inside matlab or octave, the following command will run the benchmark:

run_pagerank(scale)

where scale is the scale factor (1,10,50 or 100).


Here is the changes made to the benchmark between the two versions (diff src/powermethod.m improved/powermethod.m):
