Aspects for the benchmark
===================================

The aspect has does two things. First, it matches all function executions, and 
then it increments a count of total function calls that it keeps.
Next, it matches the execution of the function mesh2D, which is the function 
that is called by the benchmark. After this function has been completed, 
the aspect will display the total number of function calls in the program.
