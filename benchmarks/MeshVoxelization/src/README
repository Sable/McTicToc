The benchmark can be runned by using the function Benchmark. It takes as 
argument the value either, 1, 10, 50, or 100, corresponding to the micro, 
small, medium, or larger run-time scale. The function TicToc serves as a 
wrapper for Benchmark with the tic and toc commands used before and after 
the call to Benchmark.
