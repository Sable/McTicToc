The aspect I implemented records the largest size some arrays that have been 
identified by matlabâ€™s profiling engine as a growing array. It can then be 
used give a large enough initial array to increase performances.

For our benchmark, the output will be a fixed set of numbers.

The maximal size of correctionLIST was 
     0     0

The maximal size of facetCROSSLIST was 
     1    16
