BASIC USAGE
===========

The mozart benchmark can be ran either manually with the following command:

    mozart('mozart-256x256.ppm', 15, 0.5, [0 0 -1]);

Or through the driver function:

    driver_mozart(n);

Where n âˆˆ {1, 10, 50, 100}


EXTRA PARAMETERS
================

I have added two extra parameters that can be fed to the mozart function:

- A PRNG seed can be passed as an argument to ensure that multiple runs
  perform the same compuations.
- A showPlot flag that will show the 3D result.

RESIZE.SH
=========

To be able to run the driver file, we need larger versions of the image;
resize.sh will take the 256x256 image and create larger versions of it.  These
versions are not shipped in the tarball, since that would make the archive
exceed 100 MB.
