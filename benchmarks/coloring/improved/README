Optimizing the benchmark
===================================

We rewrite our benchmark program to benefit at a maximum level of the MATLAB jit optimizer

Changes:
 * all the computation are done over preallocated matrix;
 * vector built-in function are replaced by standard loop blocks;
 * loop headers use numeric indexes that are incremented until the length of the matrix is reached;
 * comparison are done on int32 typed variables;
 * we replaced function calls by matrix accesses to benefit from the CPU caches.

All these modifications are made to benefit from the jit optimizer only.
We don't expect any ameliorations with jit off or Octave (actually they make it worse).
