Aspects for the benchmark
===================================

`profileCalls` aspect class defines several metrics to profile function calls.

What we count for each function:
* nb calls
* total execution time
* parent functions (that call the current one)
* children functions (hat are called by the current one)

What we can do with this:
* see the function call chain
* see time consuming functions (that have to be optimized)
* see most called functions (that have to be optimized)

Actions are weaved around functions calls and main execiution.

`loopCalls` aspect class defines several metrics to profile loops.

What we count for each loop:
* location (function:line)
* nb executions
* total nb iterations
* total execution time

What we can do with this:
* see function using a lot of loops
* see repeatdly executed loops (that have to be optimized)
* see time consuming loops (that have to be optimized)

Actions are weaved around loops, bedofre loop bodies and around main execiution.
